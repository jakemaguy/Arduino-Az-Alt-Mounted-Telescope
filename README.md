# Stellarium-Arduino-Push-To-Telescope
The project utilizes an Adafruit Bno055 gyroscope chip to take euler rotation measurements in the X and Y direction, and converts them into equitorial coordinates.

# Still in prototyping phase
The code remains uncommented and not cleaned up as of now.  I will update the Github page with commented code and a guide that explains how to utilize the code and set up the wiring, as well as connecting the arudino to stellarium.
